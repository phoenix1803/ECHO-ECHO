# **ECHO ECHO - Voice Assistant with AI Chatbot**

ECHO ECHO is a Python-based voice assistant that integrates speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and AI-driven chatbot functionality to provide a seamless voice-driven user experience. It allows users to interact with their computers through voice commands and responses powered by AI. ECHO ECHO can open applications like Spotify, Notepad, and more, as well as handle tasks such as reminders, to-do lists, alarms, and web searches. With built-in text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, ECHO ECHO delivers a human-like voice to communicate with users.
